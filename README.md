# PortfolioWebsite

## Codecademy project

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that youâ€™ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you.
